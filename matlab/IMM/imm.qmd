title: Code Written for MATH-UA 251 Introduction to Mathematical Modeling
---
Below are MATLAB scripts I wrote for a class at NYU I took called [MATH-UA 251 Introduction to Mathematical Modeling](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/undergrad/math-ua-251/). My professor was Dr. Aref Hashemi.

## Freezing Orange Emissivity

This file graphs the temperature of fruit as it freezes despite the ambient air being above 0 degrees celsius. Below is an example:

## Charged Particle Under Influence of Drag Force and Unidirectional Potential

This file simulates the movement of a particle whose movement is affected by a drag force and a unidirectional potential. Two methods are compared: Euler's method and the perturbation method. Below is a graph that shows how the particle's velocity changes using the two different methods.

[Script that plots the velocity of the particle using both the Euler's method and the perturbation method.](https://github.com/serizawalynn/Intro-to-Math-Modeling/blob/main/hw7code.m)

## Pendulum Report

The final project for this class was to simulate the movement of a pendulum on a string or a rod, with or without air resistance.
